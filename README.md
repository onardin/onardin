My name is Ollie and I am a first-year graduate student at Columbia University, studying Computer Science. I am part of a Bridge program which is designed to equip students without a formal background in CS with the necessary tools to succeed in the Master's program. Once I have completed my Bridge coursework, I will be transitioning into the Master's program on the Machine Learning Track. Passionate about the climate crisis and seeing the boundless potential of AI, I aim to leverage my studies to develop (artificially) intelligent solutions to the climate crisis.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning the ins and outs of Java and Python.
ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with what to learn next to become an ML engineer.
ðŸ’¬ Ask me about post-war Japanese Literature! 
âš¡ Fun fact: I can speak 4 languages (not including programming ones)
